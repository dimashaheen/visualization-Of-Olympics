## Overview

This dataset allows you to ask questions about how the Olympics have changed over time, 
such as how women's participation and performance have changed over time, as well as queries regarding different nations, sports, and events.

## Goals and Motivation

Our goal is to visualize some of the asked questions regarding the history of olympics dataset,
considering a lot of terms to fully summarize all needed information. 

## Steps
* Understanding Data through plots and predifined methods. e.g(info(),describe()).
* Plotting a heatmap to show off the null values in each column.
3rd: Adjusting "Medal" column to an apprpriate values.
4th: Visualizing the distribution and the correlation of the "Age" column to determine the perfect filling method.
5th: Filling the "Age" column while putting into consideration "Event" column.
